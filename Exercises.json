{"ExerciseName":"Bench Press","ExerciseEquipment":"Barbell","ExerciseTarget":"Chest - Overall Pectoral","ExerciseSteps":"Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest. After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again.","ExerciseReps":"Low: 6-8 reps per set","ExerciseImageName":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polj819/GymGenieProject/main/BenchPress.png","ExerciseLink":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/barbell-bench-press-medium-grip"},

Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. As you have both arms extended in front of you - while holding the bar at the chosen grip width - bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. The upper torso should remain stationary. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar. After a second in the contracted position, while squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.

{"ExerciseName": "Squats","ExerciseEquipment": "Barbell","ExerciseTarget": "Legs - Overall","ExerciseSteps":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.

Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.

{"ExerciseName": "Leg Extensions","ExerciseEquipment": "Machine","ExerciseTarget": "Legs - Quadriceps","ExerciseSteps":"For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position. Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.","ExerciseReps": "Moderate: 8-12 reps per set","ExerciseImageName":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polj819/GymGenieProject/main/LegExtension.png","ExerciseLink":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/leg-extensions"},

Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second. As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position.","ExerciseReps":"Moderate: 8-12 reps per set","ExerciseImageName":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polj819/GymGenieProject/main/LegCurl.png","ExerciseLink":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/lying-leg-curls"},
{"ExerciseName": "Hip Thrusts","ExerciseEquipment": "Barbell","ExerciseTarget": "Legs - Glutes","ExerciseSteps":"Begin seated on the ground with a bench directly behind you. Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips, and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it. egin the movement by driving through your feet, extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet.
